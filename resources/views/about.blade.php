			<p> Hello, I am Shuya!</p>
			<p> I was born and raised in Beijing, China. I then started my college in Scotland, UK and after sophomore year, I transferred to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri to further my study.</p>
			<p> I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, and then I became a software developer.

			<p>Schools and Jobs. That's boring, I know!</p>
			<p>I guess you want to know more about me personally, huh?</p>
			<p>Okay! In my spare time, I like to travel around the world. I also like rock climbing and snowboarding.</p>
			<p>I love playing poker! Before becoming a software developer, I seriously considered if I should be a professional poker player. But I guess coding and creating new things just attract me more. Plus, I love to make some contributions to improve the world and help others, even just a little bit!</p>

			<p>I always keep up with technology.</p>
			<p>I enjoy learning new programming languages and working on projects for fun, as I believe working in the tech industry, I have to constantly learn new things to make myself stay on top of innovations.</p>
			<p>Because things move so fast in the tech world!</p>
